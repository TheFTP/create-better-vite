### What is QVGK Better Vite?

QVGK Better Vite is a `NPM` starter script that you can run to install an edited version of the default Vite template. This edited template comes with a router pre-installed as well as `React-Helmet` for React-based frameworks.

### Why did I create QVGK Better Vite?

I wasn't satisfied with the current template. I wanted to create a new template that could save me some time. Yep! That's it.
