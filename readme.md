### What is FTP's Better Vite?

FTP's Better Vite, an NPM starter script, can be used to install a modified version of the standard Vite template. 

This modified template for React-based frameworks and more, comes pre-installed with `React-Helmet` for customising the front end's `<Head>` tag and `React-Router-Dom` for page routing. Did I mention that the template is already configured?

### Why was FTP's Better Vite created?

We believed that the default template for Vite would be insufficient for our needs. The template required some extra functionality, and we also wanted to increase its flexibility.
That's when (and why) we created FTP's Better Vite.
