## FAQ

### What is Vite?

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.

[As per the Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

### What is FTP's Better Vite?

FTP's Better Vite, an NPM starter script that can be used to install a modified version of the standard Vite template. 

This modified template for React-based frameworks currently, comes pre-installed with `React-Helmet` for customising the front end's `<Head>` tag and `React-Router-Dom` for page routing. Did I mention that routing is already configured for use?

### What frameworks does FTP's Better Vite currently support?

- React
- Preact

### Why was FTP's Better Vite created?

We believed that the default template for Vite was insufficient for our needs. The template required some extra functionality, and we also wanted to increase its flexibility.
That's when (and why) we created FTP's Better Vite.
