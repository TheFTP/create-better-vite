### What is QVGK Create-Vite?

QVGK Create-Vite is a Starter Command for NPM that will create a React App using Vite. This is **NOT** the default Vite React Template, this one is edited to make
the template seem better and smoother.

### Why did I create QVGK Create-Vite?

I wasn't satisfied with the current template... yep! That's it.

I'm planning on adding more templates though, which will come with `React-Helmet` and `React-Router-Dom` already installed and used.
